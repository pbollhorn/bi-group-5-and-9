# BI Exam Project: Machine Learning for a Fictional Movie Streaming Company

Group members:
- Peter Bollhorn
- Tobias Thormod Birk Nielsen

In our exam project we will work with MovieStream, which is a fictional company that runs an online movie streaming platform.

MovieStream streams both its own movies as well as external movies (similar to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and HBO Max).

We will address this challenge:
- Movie Profit: Which new movies should MovieStream produce in order to make the highest profit?


## Movie Profit

When a new movie is planned, it is normal for the producers of the movie to hope to make a profit:

**_Profit (USD) = Revenue (USD) â€“ Budget (USD)_**

We will use TMDB Data from the recent years: Perhaps 5 years, 15 years or 25 years.

We will work with American Movies with Revenue, Budget and Profit in USD.

We will adjust the amounts for inflation and analyze everything in 2025 US-Dollars.
