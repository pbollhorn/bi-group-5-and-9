# Answers to questions:

Question: Is there a linear relationship between actor age and their movie count (number of movies they have appeared in)?
Answer: We made a linear regression and found a RÂ² value of 0.029. So we did not really find a linear relationship. However, we expect, that if we only looked at the actors with the top 100 movie counts, we would get a better linear relationship.
