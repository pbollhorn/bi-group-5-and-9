Hauer was born in Breukelen, Netherlands, to drama teachers Arend and Teunke, and grew up in Amsterdam. Since his parents were very occupied with their careers, he and his three sisters (one older, two younger) were raised mostly by nannies. At the age of 15, Hauer ran off to sea and spent a year scrubbing decks aboard a freighter. Returning home, he worked as an electrician and a carpenter for three years while attending acting classes at night school. He went on to join an experimental troupe, with which he remained for five years before he was cast in the lead role in the very successful 1969 television series Floris, a Dutch Ivanhoe-like medieval action drama. The role made him famous in his native country.

Hauer's career changed course when director Paul Verhoeven cast him as the lead in Turkish Delight (1973) (based on the Jan Wolkers book of the same name). The movie found box-office favour abroad as well as at home, and within two years, its star was invited to make his English-language debut in the British film The Wilby Conspiracy (1975). Set in South Africa and starring Michael Caine and Sidney Poitier, the film was an action melodrama with a focus on apartheid. Hauer's supporting role, however, was barely noticed in Hollywood, and he returned to Dutch films for several years. Hauer made his American debut in the Sylvester Stallone vehicle Nighthawks (1981), cast as a psychopathic and cold-blooded terrorist named ""Wolfgar"" (after a character in the Old English poem Beowulf). The following year, he appeared in arguably his most famous and acclaimed role as the eccentric, violent, yet sympathetic replicant Roy Batty in Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi thriller, Blade Runner.

Hauer was a dedicated environmentalist. He fought for the release of Greenpeace's co-founder, Paul Watson, who was convicted in 1994 for sinking a Norwegian whaling vessel. Hauer has also established an AIDS awareness foundation called the Rutger Hauer Starfish Foundation. He married his second wife, Ineke, in 1985 (they had been together since 1968); and he has one child, actress Aysha Hauer, who was born in 1966 and who made him a grandfather in 1988. In April 2007, he published his autobiography All Those Moments: Stories of Heroes, Villains, Replicants, and Blade Runners (co-written with Patrick Quinlan) where he discussed many of his movie roles.

Jean-Marc Barr (born on 27 September 1960 in Bitburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) is a French-American film actor and director. His mother is French. His American father was in the US Air Force and served in the Second World War. Jean-Marc Barr is primarily known as an actor, but is also a film director, screenwriter and producer. Barr is bilingual in French and English: he speaks French with a nasal, hybrid accent, reminiscent of his American upbringing - with a slight American accent and occasional anglicisms in interviews - and English with a Mid-Atlantic accent.

He studied philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles, the Paris Conservatoire and the Sorbonne. He went on to pursue an education in drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. In London he met his future wife, a pianist and composer Irina Dečermić.

Jean-Marc Barr began working in theatre in France in 1986. After some television roles and film work, in particular, Hope and Glory (1987) by John Boorman, he was cast in the tremendously successful The Big Blue (1988). Luc Besson cast him in the role of French diver Jacques Mayol. He played in the role opposite Rosanna Arquette and Jean Reno. The Big Blue was the most financially successful film in France in the 1980s.

In 1991, he starred in Danish director Lars von Trier's Europa, marking the beginning of a long friendship (he is the godfather of von Trier's children) as well as a significant professional relationship. He went on to appear in von Trier’s Europa (1991), Breaking the Waves (1996), Dancer in the Dark (2000), Dogville (2004) and Manderlay (2005). Also in 2005 he starred in the French film Crustacés et Coquillages.

His collaboration with von Trier put him on track to start directing his own work. He debuted in 1999 as a director, screenwriter and producer with the intimate love story Lovers. This film became the first part of a trilogy; the two subsequent parts being the drama Too Much Flesh (2000) and the comedy Being Light (2001) which he co-directed with Pascal Arnold.

He may also be recognized for his role as the attractive divorce lawyer, Maitre Bertram in the Merchant Ivory film le Divorce (2003). He appeared as Hugo in The Red Siren in 2002. He appeared as the main character in the video for Blur's 1995 single, ""Charmless Man"".

He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques, which are critically recognized to be among the greatest films from the 1950s. Clouzot also directed documentary films, including The Mystery of Picasso, which was declared a national treasure by the government of France.

Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from German studios due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular in France. His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.

After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa mère, Clouzot married Véra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages of Fear and Diabolique. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La Vérité, Clouzot's wife Véra died of a heart attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.

He acted in over 100 films in roles covering a wide range of genres, from light comedy to serious drama. In his later years, Curtis made numerous television appearances.

Although his early film roles were partly the result of his good looks, by the later half of the 1950's he became a notable and strong screen presence. He began proving himself to be a “fine dramatic actor,” having the range to act in numerous dramatic and comedy roles. In his earliest parts he acted in a string of ""mediocre"" films, including swashbucklers, westerns, light comedies, sports films, and a musical. However, by the time he starred in Houdini (1953) with his wife Janet Leigh, ""his first clear success,"" notes critic David Thomson, his acting had progressed immensely.

He won his first serious recognition as a skilled dramatic actor in Sweet Smell of Success (1957) with co-star Burt Lancaster. The following year he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in another drama, The Defiant Ones (1958). Curtis then gave what many believe was his best acting, in a completely different role, the comedy Some Like It Hot (1959). Thomson calls it an ""outrageous film,"" and it was voted the number 1 funniest film in history from a survey done by the American Film Institute. It costarred Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe, and was directed by Billy Wilder. That was followed by Blake Edwards’ comedy Operation Petticoat (1959) with Cary Grant. They were both “frantic comedies,” and displayed ""his impeccable comic timing."" He often collaborated with Edwards on later films.

His most significant serious part came in 1968 when he starred in the true-life drama The Boston Strangler, which some consider his ""last major film role.""

He found his largest audience in the Scandinavian countries for playing lovable characters in several of the film and TV adaptations of the children's stories by Astrid Lindgren. He attended Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Training Academy from 1949 to 1952. During his long career he appeared in over 400 works. At the 10th Guldbagge Awards in 1974, he won the award for Best Actor for his role as Emil's short-tempered father Anton Svensson in Emil and the Piglet.

His 1984 film Åke and His World was entered into the 14th Moscow International Film Festival.

In his self-written songs, he frequently attacked the injustices of society. The music is similar to folk music often using violin and accordion. He won a Swedish Grammy posthumously in 2006.

Gélin was born in Angers, Maine-et-Loire, the son of Yvonne (née Le Méner) and Alfred Ernest Joseph Gélin.

When he was ten, his family moved to Saint-Malo where Daniel went to college until he was expelled for 'uncouthness'. His father then found him a job in a shop that sold cans of salted cod. It was seeing the shooting of Marc Allégret's film Entrée des artistes that triggered his desire to go to Paris to train to be an actor. He trained at the Cours Simon in Paris before entering the Conservatoire national d'art dramatique. There he met Louis Jouvet and embarked on a theatrical career. He made his first film appearance in 1940 in Miquette and for several years was an extra or played small roles in French films. He appeared with Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich in Martin Roumagnac (1946).

He won his first leading role in Rendez-vous de juillet (1949). From that time, he went on to appear in more than 150 films, including Max Ophüls' films La Ronde (1950) and Le Plaisir (1952), Jacques Becker's Édouard et Caroline (1951), Sacha Guitry's films Si Versailles m'était conté (Royal Affairs in Versailles) (1954) and Napoléon (1955), Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Jean Cocteau's Le Testament d'Orphée (1960), Le souffle au cœur (Murmur of the Heart) (1971), and La Nuit de Varennes (That Night in Varennes) (1982). He also wrote and directed one film, The Long Teeth, in 1952.

Gélin was a leading man in French cinema during the 1950s, but his career declined with the coming of the New Wave. He worked in theater for several years, but later found new success on screen as a character actor. He appeared extensively in French films and television productions from the 1970s until his death, often playing cynical characters or grumpy old men.

In 1946, Gélin married actress Danièle Delorme with whom he had a son, actor, director and producer Xavier Gélin. They divorced in 1954. While still married to Delorme, he had an affair with 17 year old model Marie Christine Schneider that produced a daughter, Maria Schneider. Due to his status as a married man, Gélin could not recognize Maria as his daughter. He visited the child several times but eventually severed his relationship with her mother. Maria Schneider and Daniel Gélin reconnected when she was sixteen and came to visit him. They remained in contact, although their relationship was irregular.

Gélin was married to model Sylvie Hirsch from 1954 until their divorce in 1968. This marriage produced three children, Pascal (who died aged one year), Fiona , and Manuel, the latter two also becoming actors. In 1973, he remarried to Lydie Zaks with whom he had a daughter, Laura.

Gélin died in Paris on 29 November 2002 of kidney failure.

In the late 1960s, Svenson had a recurring role in the hit TV series Here Come the Brides as Lumberjack Olaf ""Big Swede"" Gustavsen.

Svenson appeared in the 1973 made-for-TV movie Frankenstein, in which he plays the Creature.

One of Svenson's first big-screen movie roles was opposite Robert Redford in The Great Waldo Pepper, where Redford and Svenson play rival ex-WWI U.S. Army Air Service pilots who are now employed in the hard and dangerous but wildly adventurous lives of 1920's barnstorming pilots, touring the Midwest.

In his next pursuit, Svenson took over the role of lawman Buford Pusser from Joe Don Baker in both sequels to the hit 1973 film Walking Tall, after Pusser himself, who had originally agreed to take over the role, died in an automobile crash. He reprised the role again for the short-lived 1981 television series of the same name.[5]

One of his most famous roles in films was as murder-witness-turned-vigilante Michael McBain in the 1976 cult classic Breaking Point. He played the Soviet agent Ivan in the Magnum, P.I. episode ""Did You See the Sunrise?"" (1982) and many years later had a cameo as an American colonel in Inglourious Basterds, as a tribute to his role in The Inglorious Bastards; he is the only actor to appear in both films.

Edward Chapman (13 October 1901 - 9 August 1977) was an English actor who starred in many films and television programmes, but is chiefly remembered as ""Mr. Wilfred Grimsdale"", the officious superior and comic foil to Norman Wisdom's character of Pitkin in many of his films from the late 1950s and 1960s.

Chapman was born in Harrogate, Yorkshire, England. On leaving school he became a bank clerk but later began his stage career with Ben Greet's Company in June 1924 at the Repertory Theatre, Nottingham, playing Gecko in George du Maurier's Trilby. He made his first London stage appearance at the Court Theatre in August 1925 playing the Rev Septimus Tudor in The Farmer's Wife. Among dozens of stage roles that followed, he played Bonaparte to Margaret Rawlings's Josephine in Napoleon at the Embassy Theatre in September 1934. In 1928 he attracted the attention of Alfred Hitchcock, who gave him the role of ""The Paycock"" in the 1930 film, Juno and the Paycock. In the same year he also made an appearance in Caste (of which no prints are known to exist). He had a role in The Citadel in 1938 and appeared alongside George Formby in the Ealing Studios comedy Turned Out Nice Again in 1941.

During the Second World War he took a break from acting and joined the Royal Air Force. After training he was posted to 129 (Mysore) Squadron as an intelligence officer. This Spitfire squadron was based at Westhampnett and Debden. The squadron was heavily engaged in combat during this period and many of Chapman's fellow squadron mates were killed in action.

Chapman first starred alongside Wisdom in 1957's Just My Luck in the role of Mr. Stoneway, but the next year in The Square Peg he appeared as Mr. Grimsdale for the first time opposite Wisdom's character of Norman Pitkin. In 1960 he and Wisdom acted together again in The Bulldog Breed, playing the roles of Mr. Philpots and Norman Puckle - Mr. Grimsdale and Pitkin in all but name. Wisdom appeared alone as Norman Pitkin in On the Beat in 1962, while Chapman branched out, starring in the Danish folktale Venus fra Vestø, but Grimsdale and Pitkin were reunited for 1963's A Stitch in Time. Their final performance together was in The Early Bird in 1965, Wisdom's first film in colour. In all, he appeared alongside Norman Wisdom in five films.

After Sir John Gielgud was arrested for ""persistently importuning male persons for immoral purposes"", Chapman started a petition to force him to resign from Equity. Sir Laurence Olivier reportedly threw Chapman out of his dressing room when he solicited his signature for the petition.

From 1965 Chapman played mostly characters roles on television. His final role was as Mr. Callon for nine episodes of the BBC's seafaring melodrama The Onedin Line between 1971 and 1972. Chapman died of a heart attack in Brighton, East Sussex, England at the age of 75.

Donnadieu was the French voice of many lead roles in English-language movies dubbed into French.

He studied theatre and literature at the Sorbonne Paris III.

Donnadieu's earliest notable film roles came in 1976 with The Tenant by Roman Polanski, and Second Chance (French: Si c'était à refaire, lit. 'If I Had to Do It All Over Again') by Claude Lelouch. The film which earned him wider recognition was Georges Lautner's 1981 action thriller, The Professional in which he had a major role, appearing with Jean-Paul Belmondo. Other notable film roles were the title part in The Return of Martin Guerre by Daniel Vigne, and in George Sluizer's The Vanishing, for which Donnadieu won best acting awards at the 1989 Madrid Film Festival and the 1990 Porto Film Festival. He was nominated for a best supporting actor César Award for his 1984 role as the dangerous criminal gang leader in Rue Barbare ('Barbarian Street'). His final film appearance was in 2008 in Christophe Barratier's Paris 36 (released in France as Faubourg 36).

Donnadieu appeared in many television and theatre productions. He played historical figures such as Hubert-Joseph Henry in the L'Affaire Dreyfus and Roger Salengro, in L'Affaire Salengro, a television film directed by Yves Boisset, with whom he regularly worked. While his appearance and physique seemed to influence directors to cast him as malevolent characters, he also had more sympathetic roles, such as the lead in the drama Faut pas rire du bonheur, in which his character has a romantic involvement with a woman, played by Laura Morante. His work dubbing French dialogue has included voicing characters portrayed by actors such as Kurt Russell, Dennis Hopper and Ron Perlman. In the theatre, he was a frequent collaborator with Georges Wilson who directed him in several productions.

Donnadieu died from cancer on 27 December 2010 at age 61.

This role follows that of manipulative reality show producer Clark Quietly in ABC’s paranormal thriller ‘The River’. Recently he has also appeared opposite Ted Danson in ‘CSI’ and Callie Thorne in ‘Necessary Roughness’.

Blackthorne was born in Shropshire, England, 1969. Blackthorne had his first acting experience at the age of 12 with the National Youth Music Theatre at the Edinburgh festival in 1981. Later he went on to study the Spiritual Psychology of Acting in London from 1996-98 before earning his first roles in British TV and film.

In 2000 he found himself in India portraying the villainous Captain Russell in the Oscar-nominated film ‘Lagaan’. The Oscar campaign brought him to Los Angeles where he went on to appear in many American TV shows including ‘24’, ‘ER’, ‘The Dresden Files’, ‘Lipstick Jungle’, ‘Deadwood’ and ‘Burn Notice’. On the feature side, he has appeared in ‘Four corners of suburbia, ‘Special’ and “A Christmas Carol.”

Alongside acting Blackthorne spent much of the 90’s traveling the world and exhibiting his photography in London. His first exhibition entitled ‘Fish Heads and other things’ raised money for Greenpeace. Another, ‘Bollywood Backpack’ raised money for the Gujarat Indian earthquake victims.

The last exhibition he held, ‘Delhi to Manhattan’, took place at Tibet House, New York in April 2009. This exhibition (view here) chronicles a journey through India trekking in the Himalayan-Tibetan communities and meeting with the Dalai Lama in Dharmsala as part of ‘The Missing Peace’ project. Proceeds from this exhibition went to the Tibetan children’s villages in India.

Recently Paul completed a documentary he produced with acclaimed Australian photographer Mister Basquali entitled ‘This American Journey’. Blackthorne’s directorial debut tells the story of the two men traveling across America interviewing everyday Americans about how they feel about the state of the country and their hopes for its future. Along the way, stereotypes are shattered and wisdom found in the most unexpected places.

In the meantime ‘Arrow’ was nominated for best new drama at the People’s choice awards 2013, ‘This American Journey’ is being submitted to film festivals and in partnership with musician James Carrington, Blackthorne is releasing an innovative app called ‘Forte’ teaching children how to read music.",1969-03-05,,2,http://www.paulblackthorne.com/,nm0085860,Acting,Paul Blackthorne,"Wellington, Shropshire, England",0.4483,/3OC1M0rKJO8B3JpwAeavk5EAscl.jpg

Born in Odense, his parents were Arthur and Inger Sprogøe. He married Eva Rasmussen in 1945, with whom he had three children. One of these is actor Henning Sprogøe. He made his debut in the film Hans Store Aften (His Big Night). His characteristic prominent chin that had been feared an obstacle of his career did not prevent him from being one of the most versatile and used Danish actors. His strength laid in the almost diabolic, michievous and brash but he effortlessly played meek and shy types as well as elegantiers. Among his many roles on stage in classic plays might be mentioned Mephisto in Faust, the title figure of Strindberg’s The Father and some Molière and Bertolt Brecht characters.

An extremely popular actor in Denmark, he played many diverse roles, including several recurring television parts. He appeared in 157 films, making him one of the hardest-working actors in the history of Danish film. In his early years he often was the part of a duo working together with his friend and colleague Dirch Passer. He is probably best known for playing one of the lead roles in the Olsen Gang movies, along with Morten Grunwald and Poul Bundgaard, playing the gang leader Egon Olsen, known for his short temper, striped suit, and cigar. By this role he earned an international fame though mostly in Eastern Europe, in the GDR he together with his colleagues became almost a cult figure. Among his TV roles must be mentioned his elegant and humorous ex-burglar Larsen in the series Huset på Christianshavn (“The House at Christianshavn” - the first Danish sitcom) and his role as the wise and courageous doctor Louis Hansen in the epic, historical drama-series Matador, both also shown outside Denmark. He was an able singer especially in shows or revues and his interpretation of Tim Spencer’s Cigarettes, whiskey and wild wild women (in Danish re-creation: Fandens Oldemor – “The Devil’s Great-Grandmother”) almost became his signature tune. He was an actor who combined great public sympathy with the ability to remain a private person with a modest lifestyle. After his death it was revealed that he had been a passionate art enthusiast and had amassed a valuable collection of modern paintings. Shortly after his death in 2004, Nordisk Film (the company that made the Olsen Gang movies) established a scholarship for actors in his name. The state-owned road to Vridsløselille Statsfængsel (the prison where his Egon Olsen character was a frequent ""guest""), was renamed by the city of Albertslund to Egon Olsens Vej (Egon Olsen Road). On 24 October 2005, his native city of Odense named a square Ove Sprogøes Plads (Ove Sprogøe Square) in his honour. And the bar 'Cafe Halvvejen', named a shot in his honor.

He is best known for playing the fourteen-year-old Tadzio in Luchino Visconti's 1971 film adaptation of the Thomas Mann novella Death in Venice.

Andrésen had only appeared in one film, En kärlekshistoria (1970) at the time he was cast in Death in Venice, which gained him international recognition. While the film performed relatively poorly at the box office, Andrésen was noted for his performance as Tadzio, the beautiful young Polish boy with whom the film's older protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach becomes obsessed. Film historian Lawrence J. Quirk commented in his study The Great Romantic Films (1974) that some shots of Andrésen ""could be extracted from the frame and hung on the walls of the Louvre or the Vatican"".

Rumors circulated in America at the time of the film's release as to whether or not Andrésen was homosexual (as the role demanded that he appear to exchange romantic glances with the protagonist, and on another occasion, be kissed and caressed by another teenage boy). Andrésen emphatically denied these, and later recounted his discomfort at being forced by director Luchino Visconti during filming to visit a gay bar, where he attracted the attention of a number of older men.  Eager to dispel the rumors regarding his sexuality and to shed his ""pretty boy"" image, Andrésen thereafter avoided homosexual roles and parts which he felt would play off of his good looks, and was angry when feminist writer Germaine Greer used a photograph of him on the cover of her book The Beautiful Boy (2003) without first obtaining his personal permission. Although Greer did consult photographer David Bailey (who owned the copyright for the image) before publishing the book, Andrésen maintained that it is common practice when a party uses an image of a person which has been copyrighted by a different individual to inform the individual and that he would not have given his consent for Greer to use his picture if she had informed him of her plans.

Andrésen has also appeared in several other films.These include Pelikaanimies (2004),  Kojan (1992) and Smugglarkungen (1985).",1955-01-26,,2,,nm0001909,Acting,Björn Andrésen,"Stockholm, Sweden",1.4705,/x3uO4FVbpLLjyyEf7xErhYo5FU.jpg

Kristian Levring is a Danish director born in 1957 in Denmark. He was the fourth signatory of Dogme95. He lived eight years in France. He graduated in editing at the National Film School of Denmark and has edited a large number of documentaries and feature films besides directing two feature films, among these, Et skud fra hjertet (1986). He is the recipient of some 23 Danish and international awards for his commercials. The King is Alive (Dogme 4) is his third feature film. The King is Alive tells the story of a mixed group of tourists in Namibia, Africa, whose bus breaks down in a remote, abandoned village (formerly a mining town). Facing starvation, dehydration, cabin fever, and death, one of the group decides to stage a production of Shakespeare's King Lear and casts the others as characters. As the thin veneer of civilized behavior breaks down, the group experiences the absurdity of putting on a play (for no audience except one lone indigenous man) in such dire and fatal circumstances. Filmed in stark digital and adhering to the tenets of Dogme filmmaking, The King is Alive is a fascinating study in the dark heart of people under extreme stress. Herzogian in its theme and mood, the film's location (remote Namibia) is as much a character in the film as the actors, like the space ship in Ridley Scott's Alien. The King is Alive features Jennifer Jason-Leigh and Brion James (Blade Runner's ""Leon""; Cabin Boy). Dark, tense, and desperate, it stands as a powerful piece of filmmaking. Levring's next film after The King is Alive is called The Intended and features some of the same actors from the former. Set in the jungle of Borneo in the 1920s, it concerns an isolated English settlement/ivory trading station. Similar in nature to The King is Alive, it focuses on what happens to small isolated groups under both internal psychological pressure and external pressure from the environment around them. As The King is Alive was filmed by Dogme rules and restrictions, The Intended instead has steady camera shots (rather than shaky/handheld) and ambient music throughout. Subtle yet powerful, the film explores Conradian contexts through the lens of a female perspective. Its influence can be seen in the Australian frontier film The Proposition.

Erik Balling was mostly famous for creating such TV epics as ""Matador"" and ""Huset På Christianshavn"" and the film-series of ""Olsen banden"". Erik Balling was born the 19th of November 1925 in the Danish city of Nyborg, as a son of a priest. In 1946 Balling was hired as an assistant at ""Nordisk Film Kompagni"" - the world's oldest film production company. His talent was soon recognised, and Balling soon had the opportunity to work as a director. His debut as a director came in 1952, with the film: ""Vi arme syndere"". Balling soon gained a reputation of having good technical skills, and after that film his talent was widely recognised. In 1957 he became head of ""Nordisk Film"" - the youngest one ever. Balling was mostly famous for his comedies. In his early days he directed Poeten og Lillemor (1959) and Sommer i Tyrol (1964), which were very popular at the time. In the middle of the 1960s Balling tried to chance his style when it came to comedies. At this time the popular James Bond films circled the globe, Balling's next film was inspired by those films, teaming up with Henning Bahs to make the Jamed Bond spoof ""Slå Først Frede"" (1965), which became very popular in Denmark - so popular it spawned a sequel Slap af, Frede! (1966). This co-work with Henning Bahs was so fruitful that they made many more movies together. This co-work eventually led to film-series of ""Olsen banden"", which started with Olsen-banden (1968) - and eventually they made a total of 14 ""Olsen banden"" film, plus a TV series and a movie version where the characters in ""Olsen banden"" are children. ""Olsen banden"" was about a small band of small time criminals, trying to become millionaires. ""Olsen banden"" were not only very popular in Denmark, but also in East-Germany, Poland, Sweden and Norway - especially in Norway and Sweden, who eventually made their own national versions of ""Olsen banden"", namely the Norwegian ""Olsen banden"" and the Swedish ""Jönssonligan"" - Henning Bahs and Erik Balling also helped the Norwegians and the Swedes to write those. In that late 60s and early 70s Balling made the popular Danish TV series ""Huset På Christianshavn"", which also became the basis for a movie: ""Ballade på Christianshavn (1971)"".  In 1970 Balling produced the very popular Danish TV epic ""Matador"". More than fifty percent of Denmark's population watched ""Matador"" in those days. ""Matador"" was about life in a smaller city in Denmark in the 30s and 40s.  Balling was always known for his warm style, when he portrayed humans. Throughout his life, he received many prizes.

She attended the prestigious acting school of the Royal Dramatic Theatre (in Swedish: Dramatens elevskola) from 1941 to 1944, and acted on the Theatre's stage from 1944 to 1964. She made her film debut in the role of Botilla in Rid i natt! in 1942.

Among her most notable roles in Swedish films were the shrewd celebrity reporter Vivi in Kärlek och störtlopp (1946), the working-class mother Rya-Rya in the drama Bara en mor (1949); Mrs. Larsson, the warmhearted mother of seven in the popular children's film Kastrullresan (1950), and the young primary school teacher in Gustaf Molander's Trots (1952) (screenplay by Vilgot Sjöman). In the mid-1950s Dahlbeck was one of Sweden's most popular and successful actresses. She became internationally known for her strong female leads in a number of Ingmar Bergman's films, in particular his comedies Secrets of Women (1952), A Lesson in Love (1954) and Smiles of a Summer Night (1955).

In the 1960s Dahlbeck moved away from acting as she started to write. She retired from the stage in 1964 and made her final appearance on screen in the Danish film Tintomara, released in 1970). She published several novels and poems in her native Sweden, and wrote the screenplay for Arne Mattsson's dark film Yngsjömordet (The Yngsjö murder) in 1966.

Dahlbeck married Sven Lampell, an air force officer, in 1944. The marriage produced two children. She lived out the last years of her life in Hässelby Villastad, Stockholm, where she died at age 87.

Sabiston began developing software as an undergraduate and then graduate researcher in the MIT Media Lab from 1986 to 1991. While at MIT, and also after moving to Austin, Texas, in 1993, Sabiston used his 2D/3D software to create several short films, including God's Little Monkey (1994), ""Beat Dedication"" (1988), and ""Grinning Evil Death"" (1990). ""Grinning Evil Death"" was widely seen on the first episode of MTV's ""Liquid Television"" show. ""God's Little Monkey"" won the Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica award for 1994. In 1997, he developed his interpolating rotoscope program, Rotoshop,[1] for an animation contest sponsored by MTV. The software was used to produce a series of 25 30-second interstitials in New York, collectively entitled ""Project Incognito."" He moved back to Austin in 1998 and with the help of local artists made the short film ""RoadHead."" This was followed in 1999 by short ""Snack and Drink"" in collaboration with Tommy Pallotta. ""Snack and Drink"" won several film festival awards and resides in the MOMA video collection. The shorts collection ""Figures of Speech"" followed in late 1999, for PBS. In 2000, Sabiston hired thirty graphic artists in the Austin area[citation needed] to help makeRichard Linklater's film Waking Life.[2] After Waking Life Sabiston spent several years making more rotoscoped short films, including ""Yard"", ""Earthlink Sucks"", ""Grasshopper"". He directed a series of shorts for the PBS show ""Life360"". In 2003 he directed a short segment for the Lars von Trier film The Five Obstructions. Both ""Grasshopper"" and ""The Five Obstructions"" were shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004. In 2004 Sabiston was hired as Head of Animation for Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly. He modified the software substantially for the film. Since 2005 he has also directed the ""Talk to Chuck"" campaign of animated advertisements for Charles Schwab. Sabiston developed Rotoshop as a means to make rotoscoping easier for artists by automating the interpolation of hand-drawn shapes and lines over video. The software isproprietary and currently not available for use outside of Sabiston's production company, Flat Black Films. Sabiston is also the creator of Inchworm Animation, a paint and animation program for the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS. It was released on April 25, 2011 in North America and subsequently in Europe, Australia, and Japan.[3] Since 2008 Sabiston has developed several apps for iOS: the 3d mind-mapping app ""Headspace"", the modeling/3d-printing app ""Voxel"", the videogame ""Retroid"", and a drawing keyboard ""Jot Keyboard"". In 2015 he released ""Lowlander"", a tribute to Richard Garriott's classic videogame ""Ultima II"".",1967-01-01,,2,,nm0754782,Directing,Bob Sabiston,United States,0.0453,/dZi8TsunmbHvTdMXvNdnNicvcnC.jpg

Dexter Gordon (February 27, 1923 – April 25, 1990) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and an Academy Award-nominated actor (Round Midnight, Warner Bros, 1986). He is regarded as one of the first and most important musicians to adapt the bebop musical language of people like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Bud Powell to the tenor saxophone. His studio and live performance career were both extensive and multifaceted, spanning over 50 years in recorded jazz history.

Gordon's height was 6 feet 6 inches (198 cm), and so consequently he was also known as ""Long Tall Dexter"" and ""Sophisticated Giant."" He played a Conn 10M 'Ladyface' tenor until it was stolen in a Paris airport in 1961. He then switched over to a Selmer Mark VI. His saxophone was fitted with an Otto Link metal mouthpiece, which can be seen in various photos. Gordon died on April 25, 1990 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an ""inventive"" cornet and trumpet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the music's focus from collective improvisation to solo performance.

With his instantly recognizable deep and distinctive gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also greatly skilled at scat singing, vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics.

Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general.

Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to ""cross over,"" whose skin-color was secondary to his amazing talent in an America that was severely racially divided. It allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a person of color.

John R. ""Johnny"" Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, actor, and author, who has been called one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Although he is primarily remembered as a country music artist, his songs and sound spanned many other genres including rockabilly and rock and roll—especially early in his career—as well as blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal led to Cash being inducted in both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Late in his career, Cash covered songs by several rock artists, among them the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails and he covered the synthpop band Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus.

Cash was known for his deep, distinctive bass-baritone voice; for the ""boom-chicka-boom"" freight train sound of his Tennessee Three backing band; for his rebelliousness, coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor; for providing free concerts inside prison walls; and for his dark performance clothing, which earned him the nickname ""The Man in Black"". He traditionally started his concerts by saying, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."" and usually following it up with his standard ""Folsom Prison Blues.""

Much of Cash's music, especially that of his later career, echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption. His signature songs include ""I Walk the Line"", ""Folsom Prison Blues"", ""Ring of Fire"", ""Get Rhythm"" and ""Man in Black"". He also recorded humorous numbers, including ""One Piece at a Time"" and ""A Boy Named Sue""; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called ""Jackson""; as well as railroad songs including ""Hey, Porter"" and ""Rock Island Line"".

Cash, a devout but troubled Christian, has been characterized as a ""lens through which to view American contradictions and challenges."" A Biblical scholar, he penned a Christian novel titled Man in White, and he made a spoken word recording of the entire New King James Version of the New Testament. Even so, Cash declared that he was ""the biggest sinner of them all"", and viewed himself overall as a complicated and contradictory man. Accordingly, Cash is said to have ""contained multitudes"", and has been deemed ""the philosopher-prince of American country music"".

After leaving the family business, Wattis became an actor. His debut was with Croydon Repertory Theatre, and he made many stage appearances in the West End in London. His first appearance in a film was A Yank at Oxford (1938), but war service interrupted his career as an actor. He served as a second lieutenant in the Small Arms Section of Special Operations Executive at Station VI during World War II (James Bond author, Ian Fleming worked in the same section). He is best known for his appearances, wearing his thick-rimmed round spectacles, in British comedies of the 1950s and 1960s, often as a ""Man from the Ministry"" or similar character. He was also involved as the secretary to Lord Scrumptious in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

Such appearances included the St Trinian's films (The Belles of St Trinian's, Blue Murder at St Trinian's, and The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery) as Manton Bassett, a civil servant who was the Deputy Director of Schools in the Ministry of Education, where he was often seen frowning and expressing indignation at the outrageous behaviour of other characters. To American audiences, Wattis is probably best known for his performance as the British civil servant Northbrook in The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). He broke from this typecasting in his later films, such as his starring role in Games That Lovers Play.

Wattis's other films included Hobson's Choice, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Carry On Spying, The Colditz Story, Dentist on the Job, Very Important Person, The Happiest Days of Your Life, and The Longest Day. He also appeared on television, including a long-running role in Sykes, and appearances in Danger Man, The Prisoner, The Goodies, Hancock's Half Hour, and Father, Dear Father.

Gabriel Gabrio (13 January 1887 – 31 October 1946) was a French stage and film actor whose career began in cinema in the silent film era of the 1920s and spanned more than two decades. Gabrio is possibly best recalled for his roles as Jean Valjean in the 1925 Henri Fescourt-directed adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, Cesare Borgia in the 1935 Abel Gance-directed biopic Lucrèce Borgia and as Carlos in the 1937 Julien Duvivier-directed gangster film Pépé le Moko, opposite Jean Gabin.

William James ""Bill"" O'Reilly, Jr. (born September 10, 1949) is an American television host, author, syndicated columnist and political commentator. He is the host of the political commentary program The O'Reilly Factor on the Fox News Channel, which is the most watched cable news television program on American television. During the late 1970s and 1980s, he worked as a news reporter for various local television stations in the United States and eventually for CBS News and ABC News. From 1989 to 1995, he was anchor of the entertainment news program Inside Edition.

O'Reilly is widely considered a conservative commentator, though some of his positions diverge from conservative orthodoxy (in particular his opposition to the death penalty). O'Reilly characterizes himself as a ""traditionalist"". O'Reilly is the author of nine books, and hosted The Radio Factor until early 2009.

Manoush was born 1972 or 1973 as Manoush Barandaj or Manoush Barandyai in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer as the third child of a mother of French Manouche Sinti and Ashkali origin and a German-American father. She was raised in Haarlem, North Holland, Cologne, (Germany) and Biel, Switzerland. At the age of 18, Manoush began modelling, but her career stopped short at age 20 after a car accident left scars on her stomach and legs. She immigrated to the United States in the summer of 2006 and returned to Europe approx. in 2015.

Manoush pursued film in 1997. In 2000, she was offered the role of the ""nymphomaniac"" in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amélie, which opened many doors in the film and TV industry for Manoush, as well as establishing her as a ""bad girl"". Manoush often gets credit as an action and horror actress or as a professional in roles which can be intense and difficult to play. In 2004 she played fighter Carda in Angel of Death 2, closely followed by Timo Rose's The Legend of Moonlight Mountain (2005), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), Timo Rose's Barricade (2007), and Andrey Iskanov's Philosophy of a Knife (2008). Manoush won Best Supporting Actress in 2011 at the PollyGrind Film Festival in Las Vegas for her role as Olga in The Super.

She started out as a cyberpunk singer. Besides her acting and writing career, she worked as a singer in the band Cyanide Savior alongside her husband, Chris Vazquez. In 2016 and 2017 she recorded two tracks with 1980s UK band Bronski Beat and US producer Man Parrish.

Ikke bare på grund af hans medvirken i et hav af tv- og radioprogrammer, men også på grund af en enorm produktivitet, der tæller bøger, satireudgivelsen Blæksprutten, adskillige dvd’er og en serie velanmeldte shows. Han var med fra stand-uppens tidlige barndom i 1991 – og siden har han findyrket sin undrende, lidt provokerende stil, blandt andet sammen med kollega Povl Carstensen.     Wivel i egen liga  Thomas Wivel har stået i spidsen af dansk stand-up i over 18 år og er en evig inspiration for alle, der holder af stand-up. Thomas Wivel kan noget med timing og levering, som ingen kan gøre ham efter, og han har energi og en utæmmelig sceneoptræden. Det ser så legende let ud, når han går på scenen, men underkend aldrig det enorme engagement, som driver Thomas Wivel. Han er tændt, hurtig og ualmindelig skarp og er senest portrætteret som ”Godfatheren”, en af hjørnestenene i dansk stand-up i ny bog om stand up comedy (2009) fra journalist og anmelder Henrik Palle og Anders Hjort.     En dynamisk duo  Siden debuten på legendariske Café Din’s i 1991 har han medvirket i flere tv-programmer, bl.a. ”Gintberg – men nok om mig”, ”Stand-up.dk” og ”Talegaver til børn”. Thomas er desuden tekstforfatter på ”Gintbergs store aften” på TV2 Zulu, og han skrev desuden for det populære underholdningsprogram ”9 ud af 10”, han har arbejdet i redaktionen på talkshowet Meyerheim og har senest været en af ankermændene bag Nyhedsministeriet på TV2. Med showet ”117 ting, vi bør vide om hinanden” skabte han og komikeren Povl Carstensen i 2005 et enestående univers, hvor rammende refleksioner over de to køn og fremragende komik gik op i en højere enhed. Showet blev fulgt op af en anmelderrost bog om emnet, udgivet på Gyldendal. I 2005 udgav Thomas desuden sit stand-up-onemanshow ”Med ryggen mod muren” på dvd. I 2006 gik Thomas på scenen med Povl Carstensen, Mette Frobenius og Omar Marzouk. De lavede showet “De hellige køer” og behandlede alvorlige emner som truslen mod ytringsfriheden, religion og terror. Showet mundede ud i bogen De hellige køer, som Thomas forfattede.     Forfatteren Wivel  Thomas er forfatter til flere bøger og skriver ofte klummer og artikler til aviser og fagblade. Han er far til fire, og måske derfor skrev han i 2006 børnebogen Svare Sara – en omvendt spørge-Jørgen, hvor forældrene bliver sat på plads. Thomas bidrog desuden sammen med en række andre stand-up-komikere med en godnathistorie til bogen Til dig fra os samt Stå op fra 2009. I flere år har han været medforfatter på Svikmøllen og skriver nu for Blæksprutten. Sammen med Povl Carstensen har Thomas blandt andet udgivetVerdenshistorien før og nu, Hvordan man overlever sin kones graviditet. En Guide til frustrerede mændsamt bøgerne Hvad enhver kvinde bør vide om mænd og Hvad enhver mand bør vide om kvinder. Han har skrevet den satiriske Hallo!, den kontroversielle debatbog om Muhammedtegningerne De hellige køer”, har oversat Bruce Springsteen på turné og har ikke mindst forfattet den anmelderroste Tysk humor.  I starten af 2009 gik Thomas atter på scenen på Comedy Zoo med sit onemanshow ”Pengene eller livet”, der var indbegrebet af god, klassisk stand-up, og som vises på TV2Zulu i efteråret 2009.",,,2,,nm1205207,Acting,Thomas Wivel,,0.0338,/wGWCa7S0muDeJgpHE6ZTO0fYblS.jpg

115863,{1232748},False,['Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz'],"Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz  (13 August 1926 – 25 November 2016) was a Cuban revolutionary and politician who served as Prime Minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976 and President from 1976 to 2008. Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist and Cuban nationalist, he also served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011. Under his administration, Cuba became a one-party communist state; industry and business were nationalized, and state socialist reforms were implemented throughout society.

Born in Birán, Oriente, the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist and anti-imperialist ideas while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with his brother Raúl Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's Prime Minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic blockade, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, resulting in the Cuban Missile Crisis – a defining incident of the Cold War – in 1962.

Adopting a Marxist–Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party, socialist state under Communist Party rule, the first in the Western Hemisphere. Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent. Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups, backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada, as well as sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur, Ogaden, and Angolan Civil War. These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuba's medical internationalism, increased Cuba's profile on the world stage. Following the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, Castro led Cuba through the economic downturn of the ""Special Period"", embracing environmentalist and anti-globalization ideas. In the 2000s, Castro forged alliances in the Latin American ""pink tide"" – namely with Hugo Chávez's Venezuela – and formed the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. In 2006, Castro transferred his responsibilities to Vice President Raúl Castro, who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008.

Indledte sin karriere som revyskuespiller i provinsen i en alder af 17 år. I en længere årrække var hun engageret ved Apolloteatret og fik sit egentlige gennembrud dér i 1943.  Uddrag fra Morten Piils ""Danske filmskuespillere"" (Gyldendal, 2003):  I 1940'ernes anden halvdel afløste hun den sygdomsplagede Liva Weel som fejret revy-dronning, men hendes stjernestatus på teatret gik ikke igen på film. Her gør hun - med sin kompakte konefigur, sit tindrende gode humør og sin indtagende djærve københavnerfacon - god fyldest i biroller. Der er noget ægte solbeskinnet ved hendes væsen, et præg af svundne tiders klippesikre ukuelighed.  Som oftest lyste hun op i folkekomedier, men hendes forlystelsessyge hustru i Carl Alstrup-dramaet ""Peter Andersen"" (1941) viser oplagt talent for karakterspil i en sjælden negativ rolle. Mere åndsbeslægtet virker dog hendes husmor fru Lykkeberg i ""Lykken kommer"" (1942) - ""et af de få livsstykker, man kan udholde"" (Jørgen Stegelmann). Her ses hun i tæt, harmonisk samspil med en overdådigt veloplagt Ib Schønberg, der som sporvognskonduktør elsker ""mutter og linie otte"" - småborgerlighed med et menneskeligt ansigt. Hun er kvindesagskvinde i ""Op med lille Martha"" (1946), og i ""Bag de røde porte"" (1951) ses hun igen i samspil med Ib Schønberg, der som indehaver af en sangerindepavillion behandler hendes gæve bakkesangerinde med tilbørlig respekt. Og i ""Fodboldpræsten"" (1951) har hun som menighedsrådsformand igen hjertet på det rette sted, omend hendes geskæftighed kan tage overhånd.

With the exception of when he reprised the character of caretaker Meyer in Erik Balling's film version of the TV series, Ballade på Christianshavn (1971). It was his best film performance. He portrayed the two TV series characters shamelessly on his distinctive type: the comically aunty as caretaker Meyer and the sly and vain as clerk Schwan. What could have ended up as a gay caricature becomes human portraits in the garb of folk comedy, not least thanks to Arthur Jensen's humor, which at once shows solidarity and irony with the characters.

It took a long time for Arthur Jensen to discovery who he was as an actor. After four silent film supporting roles at Fy&Bi, he formed a comedic duo with Ib Schønberg in several of Alice O'Fredericks' and Lau Lauritzen's energetic prank farces in the 1930s, but the fun is sporadic, and the inventions are often self-satisfied and infantile.

125479,{24284},False,['Stanley Gayetzsky'],"Stanley Getz (February 2, 1927 – June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as ""The Sound"" because of his warm, lyrical tone, with his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as ""one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists"". Getz performed in bebop and cool jazz groups. Influenced by João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim, he also helped popularize bossa nova in the United States with the hit 1964 single ""The Girl from Ipanema"".

Stan Getz was born on February 2, 1927, at St. Vincent's Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Getz's father Alexander (""Al"") was born in Mile End, London, in 1904, while his mother Goldie (née Yampolsky) was born in Philadelphia in 1907. His paternal grandparents Harris and Beckie Gayetski were originally from the Kyiv area of Ukraine but had migrated to escape the anti-Jewish pogroms to Whitechapel, in the East End of London. While in England they owned the Harris Tailor Shop at 52 Oxford Street for more than 13 years. In 1913, Harris and Beckie emigrated to the United States with their three sons Al, Phil, and Ben, following their son Louis Gayetski who had emigrated to the US the year before. Getz's original family name, ""Gayetski"", was changed to Getz upon arrival in America.

The Getz family first settled in Philadelphia, but during the Great Depression the family moved to New York City, seeking better employment opportunities. Getz worked hard in school, receiving straight A's, and finished sixth grade close to the top of his class. Getz's major interest was in musical instruments and he played a number of them before his father bought him his first saxophone when he was 13. Even though his father also got him a clarinet, Getz instantly fell in love with the saxophone and began practicing eight hours a day.

Getz attended James Monroe High School in the Bronx. In 1941, he was accepted into the All-City High School Orchestra of New York City. This gave him a chance to receive private, free tutoring from the New York Philharmonic's Simon Kovar, a bassoon player. He also continued playing the saxophone. He eventually dropped out of school in order to pursue his musical career but was later sent back to the classroom by the school system's truancy officers.

In 1943, at the age of 16, he joined Jack Teagarden's band and, because of his youth, he became Teagarden's ward. Getz also played along with Nat King Cole and Lionel Hampton. A period based in Los Angeles with Stan Kenton was brief. Following a comment from Kenton that his main influence, Lester Young, was too simple, he quit. After performing with Jimmy Dorsey, and Benny Goodman, Getz was a soloist with Woody Herman from 1947 to 1949 in ""The Second Herd"", and he first gained wide attention as one of the band's saxophonists, who were known collectively as ""The Four Brothers""; the others being Serge Chaloff, Zoot Sims and Herbie Steward. With Herman, he had a hit with ""Early Autumn"" in 1948. ...

Clinton Greyn (29 September 1936) is a Welsh-born actor noted for his appearances in British television series of the 1960s and 1970s.

He made his film debut in the 1961 short Wings of Death, and went onto appear in such popular British TV series as Z-Cars and Compact. His career progressed to a prominent role opposite Stanley Baker in Peter Yates' crime caper Robbery (1967). This led to him getting his own TV series in 1968, Virgin of the Secret Service, in which he played the dashing Captain Robert Virgin, travelling the world battling evil in the name of the British Empire. The series was not a success and he found himself making guest appearances in other adventure series, such as The Champions; Department S; and UFO.

In the early 1970s he moved to Hollywood where he appeared in a number of films, including Raid on Rommel; The Love Machine; Christa: Swedish Fly Girls; and How to Steal an Airplane (all 1971). Returning to Britain he continued to guest-star in popular television series of the period such as Jason King; The Protectors; The Zoo Gang; and Doctor Who.

More recently he has concentrated on the stage, appearing at the National Theatre as Nobel prize-winning Danish physicist Niels Bohr in Michael Frayn's Copenhagen in 2006.

Besides his acting career, he has studied architecture and design at the Open University and City University, London. He has since collaborated with Australian architect Russell Jones to build his dream home on a former bombsite in Bayswater, London.

Efter at have debuteret i en birolle i den satiriske tegne-/realfilm ""Prins Piwi"" (1974) fik hun hovedrollen i ""Piger i trøjen 2"" (1976) som den kvindelige karrieresoldat, der i årevis har narret sin mand (Klaus Pagh) til at tro, at hun blot er hjemmegående husmor. En kompetent præstation.  Hun er en lidt overklassepræget og derfor suspekt gravid kvinde i Dea Trier Mørch-filmatiseringen ""Vinterbørn"" (1978) og glider godt ind i ensemblespillet. Derefter går der 11 år, før hun igen dukker op på lærredet, denne gang som opslidset sygeplejerske i ledtog med skurken i ""Jydekompagniet 3"" (1989).

Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Levine began his musical career in 1994, when he co-founded the alternative rock band Kara's Flowers, of which he was the lead vocalist and guitarist. After the commercial failure of their only album, The Fourth World (released in 1997), the band split up. In 2001, the group was reformed – with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up – and began a new, musical chapter, changing their name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released four more albums, It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012) and V (2014). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and a World Music Award.

Since 2011, Levine has served as a coach on NBC's reality talent show The Voice. The winners of the first and fifth seasons, Javier Colon and Tessanne Chin, were on his team. In 2012, he made his acting debut as a recurring character in the horror television show American Horror Story: Asylum for the series' second season. He also appeared in the film Begin Again.

As an entrepreneur, Levine launched his own eponymous fragrance line in 2013. The same year, he collaborated with Kmart and ShopYourWay.com to develop his menswear collection. He also owns a record label, 222 Records. In 2013, The Hollywood Reporter reported that ""sources familiar with his many business dealings"" estimated Levine would earn more than $35 million that year. ",1979-03-18,,2,http://www.maroon5.com/,nm1747013,Acting,Adam Levine,"Los Angeles, California, USA",0.3041,/ucSpYIUJ0gKkHlPhQrHEs2HdFxZ.jpg

During the early 1920s, she was engaged at the Royal Danish Theatre for four seasons by request of theater director Johannes Poulsen. From 1927 to 1940 she was engaged at several theaters throughout Denmark and often left the theater to live abroad. In the early 1940s she was engaged at the Frederiksberg Theatre under direction of Svend Melsing and then the Allé-Scenen Theatre under direction of Svend Rindom. From the mid-1940s she rarely appeared on stage, but occasionally performed in radio theater.

Astrid Holm made her screen debut for Dansk Filmfabrik in 1917's Søstrene Morelli (The Sisters Morelli) and the following year was under contract to Nordisk Film. Her first film for Nordisk was a role in the 1918 Holger-Madsen-directed Folkets Ven (The People's Friend), opposite Gunnar Tolnæs and Svend Kornbeck. This was followed by several popular films for Emanuel Gregers. One of her most popular roles was as Sister Edith in the 1921 Victor Sjöström-directed Swedish silent Körkarlen (The Phantom Carriage). The film was based on the 1912 novel Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness! by Nobel prize-winning Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf. In 1925 she starred opposite Johannes Meyer in the Carl Theodor Dreyer-directed drama Du skal ære din hustru (Thou Shalt Honor Thy Wife). This would be Holm's last film role for many years.

Som barn var hun i tre år balletbarn på Det Kongelige Teaters balletskole. Sammen med Kirsten Andersen, Bjarne Kitter og Mads Højgaard var hun datidens filmbørn og turnerede også med Solby Scenen. Hun indspillede også grammofonplader med ""Fisken Osvald"", ""Swingprinsessen"" og ""Skovhusets skumle skikkelser"". Og hun debuterede på Det Kongelige Teater i 1949 som Lille Sarah i ""Indenfor murene"". Hun forlod gymnasiet som 17-årig for at starte som Lommer-pige og debuterede i december 1956 på ABC-Teatret i en revy med Kjeld Petersen og Dirch Passer. Hun havde en lille skønsang og skulle i øvrigt bare gå ud og ind i trusser og se dejlig ud. Det blev til fem år som Lommerpige på ABC-Teatret i årene 1956-1961. Det var både en lykkelig og broget affære, som bl. a. førte til sønnen Steen Stig Lommer som hun fik sammen med teaterdirektør Stig Lommer (19-06-1907 - 28-06-1976). I 1958 fik hun sin karrierens største fiasko som Polly i ""Laser og pjalter"" på Aveny Teatret, hvor hun siden var ansat fra 1961 til 1965. Hun blev uddannet på Privatteatrenes elevskole 1960-61. Lone Hertz optrådte i ""Lulus Lysthus"" i Gilleleje med Volmer-Sørensens ""Solskinsvise"". Sit store gennembrud som skuespiller fik hun i 1964 som Hedvig i ""Vildanden"" på Aalborg Teater. Hun havde siden roller f.eks. som Jane i ""Udviklinger"", Nora i ""Et dukkehjem"" på Folketeatret, Jeanne d'Arc i ""Lærken"", Hilde i ""Bygmester Solness"", Rosalinde i ""Som man behager"" og kvinden i ""Århundredets kærlighedseventyr"". Hun var ansat ved Det Kongelige Teater 1968-73 samt i 1975 og spillede her bl.a. Ellen i ""Skærmydsler"" og Agnes i ""Fruentimmerskolen"". Hun vakte opmærksohed med nøgenscener i ""Vidunderlige kælling"" i 1975. På TV fik hun roller som dramatisk skuespillerinde i Ionescos ”Enetime” og Genets ”Stuepigerne”. Og indenfor cabaretgenren optrådte hun på sin bror Tony Rodian's cabaret. Hendes første filmroller var som barnestjerne i ""Hold fingrene fra mor"" og ""Vores fjerde far"". Hun huskes for rollen som Tine i filmen af samme navn, som gav hende en Bodil. Det var under optagelser til denne, at hun – på sin 25 års fødselsdag – fik Clara Pontoppidans fødselsdagslegat for at være en af de mest talentfulde unge danske skuespillerinder. Desuden havde hun bl.a. tiltelrollen i operettefilmen ""Frk. Nitouche"" og rollen som Klara i ""Sommer i Tyrol"". I årene 1962 til 1975 levede hun sammen med skuespilleren Axel Strøbye. Sammen fik de datteren Micaëla og sønnen Tomas. Noget af det, der har vendt op og ned på hendes liv, var, da hun i 1966 blev mor til sin udviklingshæmmede søn Tomas Strøbye (20-02-1966).

I 1984 blev hun rektor på Statens Teaterskole, hvilken stilling hun bestred indtil 1990. På Statens Teaterskole fik hun indført det fjerde uddannelsesår for skuespillere, instruktører og scenografer.

Thorsen began his artistic career attending periodically the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. However he chose to produce and create art that was meant to be provocative. This included a number of public displays protesting various governmental issues.Thorsen also wrote, directed, and starred in a number of films, the most notable of them being Stille dage i Clichy, based on a Henry Miller novel.

In painting, Thorsen also stirred up controversy with a work depicting Jesus in a manner some considered pornographic. Thorsen planned a film called The Many Faces of Jesus, which was about the sex life of Jesus, and was to have involved both heterosexual and homosexual acts. The film was to have been made in Britain, but it faced intense opposition from pressure groups, as well as from the Queen, then Prime Minister James Callaghan, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggan. The film was never made. Thorsen painted a number of abstract works, which have become increasingly collectible. He was also a jazz musician and co-founder of the group ""Papa Bue's Viking Jazzband"".

In 1979 he formed the comedy group Linie 3 along with Preben Kristensen, with whom he had previously had the four-man group Barbershop Harmony, and Thomas Eje. Linie 3 premiered their first TV show in 1980.

In 2001 Linie 3 appeared in a millennium show called Rundrejsen 2001 that was seen by more than 300,000 people. Linie 3 had their 25th anniversary-show in 2004. They then broke up for some years and Eje spent time in the US; they reformed in 2011. Their comeback show in April 2012 at the Tivoli Theatre in Copenhagen was a success and was followed by a nationwide tour.

Bircow has also appeared in his own one-man-show, mostly at company and private events. He has directed plays and translated drama and animated cartoons. He has voiced many cartoon characters and is the official voice of Mickey Mouse in Denmark.

In addition to acting and entertainment, he was the chief representative of Amway in Denmark for many years. He lodged a successful complaint against a newspaper which characterised this as investment in a pyramid scheme.

575722,"{125889, 28414}",False,[],"Édouard Louis Joseph, Baron Merckx (born 17 June 1945), known as Eddy Merckx, is a Belgian former professional road and track cyclist racer who is the most successful rider in the history of competitive cycling. His victories include an unequalled eleven Grand Tours (five Tours de France, five Giros d'Italia, and a Vuelta a España), all five Monuments, setting the hour record, three World Championships, every major one-day race other than Paris–Tours, and extensive victories on the track.

Born in Meensel-Kiezegem, Brabant, Belgium, he grew up in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre where his parents ran a grocery store. He played several sports, but found his true passion in cycling. Merckx got his first bicycle at the age of three or four and competed in his first race in 1961. His first victory came at Petit-Enghien in October 1961.

After winning eighty races as an amateur racer, he turned professional on 29 April 1965 when he signed with Solo–Superia. His first major victory came in the Milan–San Remo a year later, after switching to Peugeot–BP–Michelin. After the 1967 season, Merckx moved to Faema, and won the Giro d'Italia, his first Grand Tour victory. Four times between 1970 and 1974 Merckx completed a Grand Tour double. His final double also coincided with winning the elite men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships to make him the first rider to accomplish cycling's Triple Crown. Merckx broke the hour record in October 1972, extending the record by almost 800 metres.

He acquired the nickname ""The Cannibal"", suggested by the daughter of a teammate upon being told by her father of how Merckx would not let anyone else win. Merckx achieved 525 victories over his eighteen-year career. He is one of only three riders to have won all five 'Monuments' (Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and the Giro di Lombardia) and the only one to have won them all at least twice. Merckx was successful on the road and also on the track, as well as in the large stage races and one-day races. He is almost universally regarded as the greatest and most successful rider in the history of cycling.

Since Merckx's retirement from the sport on 18 May 1978, he has remained active in the cycling world. He began his own bicycle brand, Eddy Merckx Cycles, in 1980 and its bicycles were used by several professional teams in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. Merckx coached the Belgian national cycling team for eleven years, stopping in 1996. He helped start and organize the Tour of Qatar from its start in 2002 until its final edition in 2016. He also assisted in running the Tour of Oman, before a disagreement with the organizers led him to step away in 2017.

Han voksede op i et hjem med tilknytning til Det ny Teater, hvor han debuterede 22. marts 1913 i Alexander den Store. Derefter kom han på provinsturne og blev siden elev på Det kgl. Teater, hvor han debuterede i 1919 som Helmuth i ""En skavank"". I 1925 forlod han nationalscenen og blev et par år senere - gennem flere år - en af de mest benyttede kunstnere på Apollo Teatret. Han havde derudover engagementer ved Nørrebros Teater, Komediehuset og Det ny Teater. I størstedelen af 30erne var han knyttet til Betty Nansen Teatret, hvor han spillede et imponerende antal roller indenfor det lettere klassiske repertoire. Han havde store successer i roller som Polonius i Kaj Munks ""Hamleth"", Noah i ""Guds grønne enge"" og som præsten i ""Ordet"" - alle på Betty Nansen Teatret.

Han medvirkede også i en række danske spillefilm. I 1956 fik han en biografbevilling til Skovshoved Bio, men dette ekstra arbejde tog så hårdt på hans kræfter - at han under en sceneprøve på Folketeatret blev ramt af et hjerteanfald og døde. Knud Heglund var medlem af Teaterrådet fra 1948 og af bestyrelsen for Olaf Poulsens Mindefond. Sammen med skuespillerinden Sophie Damaris Andersen fik han sønnen Jørgen Ole Heglund (19-06-1918).

Leida Rammo had an extensive film career, appearing in over thirty feature films. Her first significant film role was that of Lisete in the 1964 Grigori Kromanov and Jüri Müür-directed Tallinnfilm epic-drama Põrgupõhja uus Vanapagan, based on the 1939 novel of the same name by A. H. Tammsaare. Rammo, however, was initially displeased when she saw herself in film dailies and was overly-critical of her appearance and acting, but the following year accepted a smaller role in the Tallinnfilm drama Mäeküla piimamees, directed by former Estonian State Theatre Institute classmate Leida Laius, and adapted from the 1916 novel of the same name by Eduard Vilde. In 1967, she appeared as Klara Kukk in the popular Veljo Käsper-directed Tallinnfilm comedy Viini postmark and followed with the role of Hermiine in the 1968 Kaljo Kiisk-directed Tallinnfilm historic-thriller Hullumeelsus.

Rammo worked steadily in films throughout the 1970s. Some notable performances of the era include the roles of Elve in the 1972 Kaljo Kiisk-directed drama Maaletulek, and as Laine in the 1972 Sulev Nõmmik-directed comedy television film Noor pensionär for Eesti Telefilm. In 1983, she appeared in the Kaljo Kiisk-directed Nipernaadi, an adaptation of August Gailit's 1928 novel Toomas Nipernaadi. In 1985, she appeared in the role of Anna on the Eesti Televisioon (ETV) series Rudolf ja Irma, based on the 1934 novel Elu ja armastus by A. H. Tammsaare. In 1988, she played the role of Marta Tooming in the Leida Laius-directed drama Varastatud kohtumine.

Rammo continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s, albeit often in smaller roles. Some notable performances of the era include the 1992 Lembit Ulfsak-directed family-comedy film Lammas all paremas nurgas, the 1995 Andrew Grieve-directed English and Estonian language drama Kirjad idast, and the 1998 Rao Heidmets-directed family film Kallis härra Q, which was an adaptation of story of the same name by children's author Aino Pervik. Rammo's film roles continued into the 2000s and 2010s, with her last film role at age ninety-one in the 2015 Klaus Härö-directed Golden Globe Award-nominated historic-drama Vehkleja, starring Märt Avandi.

In her eighties and nineties, Rammo also appeared in a number of small roles or guest roles on Estonian television in the late 2000s and 2010s: the Kanal 2 crime series Kelgukoerad in 2007, the TV3 comedy-crime series Kättemaksukontor in 2010, the TV3 comedy series Ment in 2012, and the TV3 comedy series Padjaklubi in 2014.

Leida Rammo was married to journalist Avo Lorents, who died in 1986. The couple have one child; a daughter named Kai. She was a grandmother and great-grandmother. Rammo had been an outspoken atheist since she was a young girl.

Rammo's eyesight diminished in her later years and she spent much of her time reading at the library for the blind. Her daughter often kept her company and read to her as well.",1924-04-18,2020-07-23,1,,nm1156196,Acting,Leida Rammo,"Tallinn, Harju County, Estonia",0.0311,/lMpCre04Pufbc49Ec950gksilsm.jpg

Dorociński was born in Milanówek and grew up in a small village, Kłudzienko. His father is a blacksmith, and his mother is a housewife. He has three brothers, all of whom are police officers. He dreamt of becoming a professional football player. However, he was forced to give up the plan after sustaining a significant leg injury. He attended the vocational school in Grodzisk Mazowiecki and obtained a machinist certificate. The first person to notice his talent for acting was his history teacher, who encouraged him to become an actor. In 1993, he enrolled at the Aleksander Zelwerowicz State Theatre Academy.

In his second year at the State Theatre Academy, he was cast as Don Rodrigue in a television adaptation of Le Cid directed by Krystyna Janda. After graduating from the Academy in 1997, he struggled to find acting jobs. He worked as a waiter and a bouncer. He took other casual jobs until he was offered a post at the Dramatic Theatre in Warsaw. He has also appeared in several plays at the Ateneum Theatre in Warsaw, where he is currently employed.

He played minor roles in multiple television series before his breakthrough came with the role in Patryk Vega's 2005 film Pitbull, which brought him the Zbyszek Cybulski Award. He is a two-time Polish Film Festival award winner for his  Reverse (2009) and Rose (2011) roles.  The latter also earned him the IFFI Best Actor Award at India's 43rd International Film Festival. In 2012, he appeared in Magdalena Łazarkiewicz's critically acclaimed TV series The Deep End (""Głęboka woda""), which earned him a nomination for Best Actor Award at the Monte Carlo Television Festival. Between 2012 and 2013, Dorociński appeared in a miniseries called Spies of Warsaw, co-produced by the and Telewizja Polska.

In 2020, he joined the cast of the Netflix drama miniseries The Queen's Gambit, starring Anya Taylor-Joy. Based on the 1983 novel by Walter Tevis of the same name, the show explores the life of an orphan chess prodigy named Beth Harmon from the age of eight to twenty-two as she struggles with addiction in a quest to become a grandmaster in chess. Dorociński plays Soviet world chess champion Vasily Borgov.

He is married to scenic designer Monika Sudół. The couple has a son, Stanisław (born 2006), and a daughter, Janina (born 2008). They also brought up Sudół's son from a previous relationship, Jakub.

A Swing style virtuoso, he played and recorded with many of the other jazz musicians, including Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Stephane Grappelli. He played publicly until 2010 when he had a blood clot, his career having spanned eight decades.

Asmussen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, was raised in a musical family, and started taking violin lessons at the age of seven. Aged 16 he first heard recordings by jazz violinist Joe Venuti and began to emulate his style. He started working professionally as a violinist, vibraphonist, and singer at age 17, leaving his formal training behind for good. Early in his career he worked in Denmark and on cruise ships, with artists such as Josephine Baker and Fats Waller. Asmussen later was greatly influenced by Stuff Smith, whom he met in Denmark. Asmussen played with Valdemar Eiberg and Kjeld Bonfils during World War II, during which time jazz had moved to the underground and served as a form of political protest.

In the late 1950s, Asmussen formed the trio Swe-Danes with singer Alice Babs and guitarist Ulrik Neumann. The group became quite successful in Scandinavia for their music hall style entertainment and also toured the United States. Asmussen also worked with Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, and Duke Ellington. Asmussen was invited by Ellington to play on his Jazz Violin Session recording in 1963 with Stéphane Grappelli and Ray Nance.

In 1966, Asmussen appeared alongside Grappelli, Stuff Smith, and Jean-Luc Ponty in a jazz Violin Summit in Switzerland that was issued as a live recording. He made an appearance at the 1967 Monterey Jazz Festival, which included a celebrated violin summit with him, Ray Nance and Jean-Luc Ponty. In 1969, he guested on Snakes in a Hole, an album by the jazz-rock band Made in Sweden. He was still active playing violin at the age of 94.

Asmussen became a centenarian on 28 February 2016. He died peacefully in his sleep on 7 February 2017, just 3 weeks before his 101st birthday.

Asmussen's collection of jazz music, photographs, posters and other material is held in the jazz collections at the University Library of Southern Denmark. Asmussen's son, Claus Asmussen, is a guitar player in Denmark and a former member of the band Shu-Bi-Dua.

In 2009 Samuelsson won the Swedish version of the television series Dancing with the Stars, beating songwriter Laila Bagge in the final.

Rieu and his orchestra have turned classical and waltz music into a worldwide concert touring act. He resides in his native Maastricht.

The name Rieu is of French Huguenot origin, though both of Rieu's parents were Roman Catholic. André was born to Andries Antonie Rieu and is the third of six children.

Rieu's father was conductor of the Maastricht Symphony Orchestra. Showing early promise, André began studying violin at the age of five. From a very early age, he developed a fascination with orchestra. He studied violin at the Conservatoire Royal in Liège and at the Conservatorium Maastricht, (1968–1973), studying under Jo Juda and Herman Krebbers.

From 1974 to 1977, he attended the Music Academy in Brussels, studying with André Gertler. He completed his training with the distinction ""Premier Prix"" from the Royal Conservatory of Brussels.

He married Marjorie Kochmann in 1975. She has been a language teacher and has written compositions. They have two sons.

He speaks six languages: Dutch, English, German, French, Italian and Spanish.

Rieu created the Johann Strauss Orchestra in 1987 and began with 12 members, giving its first concert on 1 January 1988. As of 2020, he performs with between 50 and 60 musicians. Rieu plays a 1667 Stradivarius violin.

Rieu and his orchestra have appeared throughout Europe, North and South America, Japan, and Australia. In 2008, Rieu's tour featured a full-size reproduction of Empress Sisi's Castle, the biggest stage to have gone on tour at that time.

For two weeks in 2013, one of the channels of the BSkyB group, Sky Arts 2 in the UK, was renamed as Sky Arts Rieu. Between 30 March and 14 April 2013 Sky Arts Rieu broadcast Rieu concerts and documentaries 24 hours per day.

Rieu also composed music for the 2014 film Tuscan Wedding.

Rifbjerg was born in Copenhagen and grew up on the island of Amager, which is part of the city, the child of two teachers. Later he studied English and literature, in Copenhagen and for a year in the US at Princeton University.

His breakthrough was in 1958 with the novel Den kroniske Uskyld. It was made into a film in 1985, directed by Edward Fleming. From that time on he published more than 100 novels as well as poetry and short story collections, plays, TV and radio plays, film scripts, children's books and diaries. Rifbjerg is also known for having been a journalist and critic. Along with Villy Sørensen, he was editor of the publication Vindrosen, and from 1984 to 1991 he was the literary director of Gyldendal.

Among other honors, he was awarded the Swedish Academy Nordic Prize (1999), known as the 'little Nobel'[citation needed]; The Nordic Council's Literature Prize (1970), the Rungstedlund Award (2009) and the grand prize of the Danish Academy (1966).

Rifbjerg has been seen as the first true modernist author in Danish, as he became increasingly more experimental though the 1960s, culminating with Anna (jeg) Anna. Many of his works from 1970 and some 25 years on are seen as being looser in scope and composition, often humorous or sarcastic, often leaving the protagonist chaotically alone with his or her existential and psychological hangups, subtly exemplifying modernism as the breakdown of the normality of the bourgeoisie. A principal theme is the portrayal of children and their difficulties establishing their own identity. Rifbjerg's works from the 2000s opened a new line of inspiration: historic events.

On 4 April 2015 Rifbjerg died in Copenhagen after a long illness, aged 83.",1931-12-15,2015-04-04,0,,nm0726440,Writing,Klaus Rifbjerg,"Copenhagen, Denmark",0.6732,/oNwcn73Su1NYKGwicim2ukEhLln.jpg

Sissel is considered one of the world's top crossover sopranos, her musical style ranges from pop recordings and folk songs, to classical vocals and operatic arias. She possesses a ""crystalline"" voice and wide vocal range, sweeping down from mezzo-soprano notes, in arias such as Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix from Saint-Saëns's opera Samson et Dalila, to the F natural above soprano C. She sings mainly in English and Norwegian, and has also sung songs in Swedish, Danish, Irish, Italian, French, Russian, Icelandic, Faroese, German, Neapolitan, Māori, Japanese, and Latin.

She is well known for singing the Olympic Hymn (Hymne Olympique) at the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway; for duets with Plácido Domingo, Charles Aznavour, José Carreras, Neil Sedaka, Warren G, Brian May, Bryn Terfel, Josh Groban, Diana Krall, Russell Watson and The Chieftains; and her participation on the Titanic film soundtrack.

Sissel received her first U.S. Grammy nominations on 6 December 2007 for a collaboration with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Spirit of the Season, a collection of songs from the choir's 2006 Christmas concert at Temple Square, was nominated for the Best Classical Crossover Album of the Year, as well as Best Engineered Classical Album.

Sissel's combined solo record sales (not including soundtracks and other albums to which she contributed) amount to 10 million albums sold, most of them in Norway, a country with 5 million people. Her albums have also sold well in Sweden, Denmark and Japan. Together with Odd Nordstoga, they are the only Norwegian artists to have an album go 11 times platinum in album sales for Strålande jul"" (Glorious Christmas).

He studied at the Calle Flygares Theater School in Stockholm to become an actor.  But before his debut as an actor, he had already debuted in 2005 as a stand-up comedian at Bungy Comedy, a Swedish club for stand-up beginners. In 2006 he enrolled at Standup Star, a stand-up school, where among others, Özz Nûjen and Jakob Öqvist, two of the most well-known comedians in Sweden, have attended.

As of 2008, his most notable appearance was in Melodifestivalen 2008, the Swedish selections for the Eurovision Song Contest. For example, he sang a song to Kristian Luuk's  (the host) girlfriend Carina Berg. In his song he declared his love for  her. Afterward, Berg said that she had to hide her cheeks so people  couldn't see that she was blushing.

Gustafsson gained a certain degree of international fame following a World of Warcraft (WoW) joke in Parlamentet,  talking about people wasting time on the internet and not contributing  to their party's effort by playing inefficiently, using so much internal  WoW terminology himself that he was incomprehensible to non-players. The scene was spread over the Internet, mainly on YouTube, where translations into other languages could also be found.

In 2008, Björn received big media attention by great efforts in Parlamentet and as an entertainment in the breaks to Melodifestivalens and he also got voted as the Sweden's funniest man by Aftonbladet's readers on 6 March 2008. He also read the Swedish votes at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. He continued his ""stand-up"" shows at the big stage, in the 44th Guldbagge Awards in 2009 together with Johan Glans, and with Robert Gustafsson in the Svenska idrottsgalan 2009 (Swedish athletics awards) where he also presented the nominations for rookie of the year.",1986-02-19,,2,http://www.bjorngustafsson.se/,nm2930714,Acting,Björn Gustafsson,"Kungälv, Västra Götalands län, Sweden",0.7332,/70iVhIfiswXAHDqKWMhSSFAIkhH.jpg

1066986,{1490217},False,[],"Zlatan Ibrahimović (born 3 October 1981) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a striker. Ibrahimović is renowned for his acrobatic strikes and volleys, powerful long-range shots, and excellent technique and ball control. He is regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time and is one of the most decorated active footballers in the world, having won 34 trophies in his career. He has scored over 570 career goals, including more than 500 club goals, and has scored in each of the last four decades.

Ibrahimović began his career at Malmö FF in 1999, and signed for Ajax two years later, where he gained a reputation as one of the most promising forwards in Europe. He departed two years later to sign for Juventus before joining domestic rivals Inter Milan in 2006, where he won three consecutive Serie A titles. In the summer of 2009, he moved to Barcelona in one of the world's most expensive transfers. After just one season, he returned to Italy having signed for Inter's rival Milan. With them, he won the Serie A title in his debut season. In 2012, Ibrahimović joined Paris Saint-Germain, leading them to their first Ligue 1 title in 19 years and soon establishing himself as a leading figure in their dominance of French football. During his four-season stay in France, he won four consecutive Ligue 1 titles, was the top scorer in Ligue 1 for three seasons and became PSG's all-time leading goalscorer at the time. In 2016, he joined Manchester United on a free transfer and won his first European honour in his debut season. Ibrahimović joined American club LA Galaxy in 2018 and rejoined Milan in 2020, winning his fifth Serie A title in 2022.

Ibrahimović is one of eleven players to have made 100 or more appearances for the Swedish national team, over a 20-year international career. He is the country's all-time leading goalscorer with 62 goals. He represented Sweden at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 UEFA European Championships. He has been awarded Guldbollen (the Golden Ball), given to the Swedish player of the year, a record 12 times, including 10 consecutive times from 2007 to 2016. Ibrahimović's 35-yard bicycle kick goal for Sweden against England won the 2013 FIFA Puskás Award, and is often considered one of the best goals of all time.

Ibrahimović was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI in 2013 and the UEFA Team of the Year in 2007, 2009, 2013 and 2014. He finished at a peak of fourth for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2013. In 2015, UEFA ranked him as the best player ever not to have won the UEFA Champions League, while in 2019, FourFourTwo magazine named him the third-greatest player never to win the competition. In December 2014, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter ranked him the second-greatest Swedish sportsperson ever, after tennis player Björn Borg. Off the field, Ibrahimović is known for his brash persona and outspoken comments, in addition to referring to himself in the third person.",1981-10-03,,2,,nm1257417,Acting,Zlatan Ibrahimović,"Malmö, Skåne län, Sweden",0.1948,/kX5ellKSqI7EN87DwvCOcaDJivJ.jpg

Einar Hanson (June 15, 1899; Stockholm, Sweden – June 3, 1927; Santa Monica, California), also known as Einar Hansen, was a Swedish silent film motion-picture actor.

Discovered at Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre by director Mauritz Stiller, handsome and sophisticated, he was in 1927 ideally positioned to take over from the late Rudolph Valentino as Hollywood's ""great screen lover"".

Upon his arrival in Hollywood in 1925, along with Stiller and the director's other protegée Greta Garbo, Hanson starred opposite some of the era's leading ladies, including Pola Negri and Corinne Griffith.

Hanson was destined for even bigger and better things at Paramount Pictures, who had bought his original five-year contract from Universal Studios. He showed great progress opposite Clara Bow and Esther Ralston in Children of Divorce, as well as The Woman on Trial and Barbed Wire both with Pola Negri, and Fashions for Women (all 1927), directed by Dorothy Arzner.

On June 3, 1927, Hanson was on his way home from having dinner with Stiller and Garbo when his car apparently skidded off the road on the Pacific Coast Highway near Topanga Canyon and died on the way to the hospital.

In 1979, Lockwood released his first album as a leader, New World, and recorded more than 20 albums. In 1994, he moved to New York City for two years. During that time he recorded two albums, New York Rendez Vous and Storyboard. Lockwood's influences include violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. He started playing electric violin after hearing Ponty on the album King Kong: Jean-Luc Ponty Plays the Music of Frank Zappa. Another important influence was Frenchman Stéphane Grappelli. In 2000, Lockwood recorded a tribute album to Grappelli.

Grey is known for his work on ""O Segredo da Múmia"" (1982), ""A Dança dos Bonecos"" (1986) and ""As Sete Vampiras"" (1986). ""O Segredo da Múmia"" was one of the few feature films where he played the main character in his entire career.

1150009,{374848},False,"['Jean-Baptiste Frédéric Isidor, Baron Thielemans']","Jean-Baptiste Frédéric Isidor, Baron Thielemans (29 April 1922 – 22 August 2016), known professionally as Toots Thielemans, was a Belgian jazz musician. He was mostly known for his chromatic harmonica playing, as well as his guitar and whistling skills, and composing. According to jazz historian Ted Gioia, his most important contribution was in ""championing the humble harmonica"", which Thielemans made into a ""legitimate voice in jazz"". He eventually became the ""preeminent"" jazz harmonica player.

His first professional performances were with Benny Goodman's band when they toured Europe in 1949 and 1950. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1951, becoming a citizen in 1957. From 1953 to 1959 he played with George Shearing, and then led his own groups on tours in the U.S. and Europe. In 1961 he recorded and performed live one of his own compositions, ""Bluesette"", which featured him playing guitar and whistling. In the 1970s and 1980s, he continued touring and recording, appearing with musicians such as Oscar Peterson, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Bill Evans, Dizzy Gillespie, Kenny Werner, Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Mina Mazzini, Elis Regina, Quincy Jones, George Shearing, Natalie Cole, Billy Joel, Paul Simon and Paquito D'Rivera.

Thielemans recorded the soundtracks for The Pawnbroker (1964), Midnight Cowboy (1969), The Getaway (1972), Cinderella Liberty (1973), The Sugarland Express (1974) and Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977). His harmonica theme song for the popular Sesame Street TV show was heard for 40 years. He often performed and recorded with Quincy Jones, who once called him ""one of the greatest musicians of our time."" In 2009 he was designated a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honor for a jazz musician in the United States.

Thielemans was born in Brussels on 29 April 1922. His parents owned a café. He began playing music at an early age, using a homemade accordion at age three. During the German occupation of Belgium beginning in 1940, he became attracted to jazz, but was then playing on a full-size accordion or a harmonica, which he taught himself to play in his teens.

After being introduced to the music of Belgian-born jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, he became inspired to teach himself guitar, which he did by listening to Reinhardt's recordings. At the time he was a college student majoring in mathematics. By the war's end in 1945, he considered himself a full-time musician. He said in 1950, ""Django is still one of my main influences, I think, for lyricism. He can make me cry when I hear him."" During an interview in 1988, he recalled, ""I guess I was born at the right time to live and adapt and be touched by the evolution in the jazz language.""[

He played in two Silverio Pisu stories: Giacomino passerotto vagabondo and Manolo gattino sognatore.

In 1949 he joined a jam session in Paris with Sidney Bechet, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Max Roach and others. He first heard the faster bebop style of jazz from records by Parker and Dizzy Gillespie after they had reached Belgium after the war. They became his musical ""prophets."" As his small collection of jazz records grew, the music of Benny Goodman and Lester Young began to impress him the most. ...

1165008,{79433},False,"['Kevin Smadja', ""Kev' Adams"", 'Кев Адамс']","Kev Adams or Kev' Adams (born Kevin Smadja; 1 July 1991) is a French comedian, actor, humorist, screenwriter and film producer.

Adams was born in 1991 in the 16th district of Paris. His father is a real estate agent of Algerian Jewish descent and his mother, of Tunisian Jewish descent, works in finance. He has two younger brothers, Noam and Lirone. He began taking theater classes at the age of seven. In 2009, Adams completed his French Baccalaureate in literature, and enrolled in law at the University of Paris X-Nanterre while simultaneously pursuing his acting career. He claimed that it was, ""extremely difficult, nearly impossible, to balance both.""

In 2009, Adams was spotted by Elisa Soussan, Anne Roumanoff's producer, who invited him to perform at her Carte Blanche show at the Olympia (Paris). This stage performance was broadcast on Paris Première. Following this event, Adams was offered to be the opening act of a Gad Elmaleh show at the Palais des Sports. His first one-man show, The Young Man Show, first ran in Paris in 2009 at the Théâtre Le Temple and then continued at the Palais des Glaces before touring France. The tour ended in Switzerland on July 22, 2012, during the Paléo Festival de Nyon. He then performed a show called Test… Voilà, Voilà! at the Bataclan from November 27 to December 31, 2013.

As of May 2014, Adams has more than 3 million fans on Facebook and more than 1 million followers on Twitter and in 2017 more 4 million followers on instagram.

From September 2010 to February 2011, Adams was a contestant on the TV program On n'demande qu'à en rire (""We just want to laugh at it"", literally ""We ask only to laugh at it"") hosted by Laurent Ruquier. He left the show voluntarily to dedicate himself to the Soda television series, in which he plays a major role. Soda depicts the daily life of three boys and includes guest stars such as La Fouine and Amel Bent. Since the summer of 2011, the series has been broadcast on M6, and on W9 in 2012. Season three close the series in 2015.

The same year he has his biggest box office successes with Serial Teachers, as the almost-school dropout and his adventures with the worst teachers of France, and The New Adventures of Aladdin, as one of the thieves caught by the children in the midst of a robbery on Christmas Eve.

In 2018, he created the animated series Kev's World (""Le Monde selon Kev""). He also voiced himself in the original French version.

Prior to his presidency, he was First Secretary of the Socialist Party (PS) from 1997 to 2008, Mayor of Tulle from 2001 to 2008, as well as President of the General Council of Corrèze from 2008 to 2012. Hollande also held the 1st constituency of Corrèze seat in the National Assembly twice, from 1988 to 1993 and again from 1997 until 2012.

Born in Rouen and raised in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hollande began his political career as a special advisor to newly elected President François Mitterrand, before serving as a staffer for Max Gallo, the government's spokesman. He became a member of the National Assembly in 1988 and was elected First Secretary of the PS in 1997. Following the 2004 regional elections won by the PS, Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but he resigned as First Secretary and was immediately elected to replace Jean-Pierre Dupont as President of the General Council of Corrèze in 2008. In 2011, Hollande announced that he would be a candidate in the primary election to select the PS presidential nominee; he won the nomination against Martine Aubry, before he was elected to the presidency (becoming also, ex officio, Co-Prince of Andorra) on 6 May 2012 in the second round with 51.6% of the vote, defeating incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy.

During his tenure, Hollande legalized same-sex marriage by passing Bill no. 344, reformed labour laws and credit training programmes, signed a law restricting the cumul des mandats, and withdrew French forces in Afghanistan, in addition to concluding an EU directive on the protection of animals in laboratory research through a Franco-German contract. Hollande led the country through the January and November 2015 Paris attacks, as well as the 2016 Nice attack. He was a leading proponent of EU mandatory migrant quotas and NATO's 2011 military intervention in Libya. He also sent troops to Mali and the Central African Republic with the approval of the UN Security Council in order to stabilise those countries, two operations however largely seen as failures. He drew controversy among his left-wing electoral base for supporting the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

Under Hollande’s presidency, Paris hosted the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference and his efforts to bring the 2024 Summer Olympics to the city were successful. However, with domestic troubles – in particular due to Islamic terrorism – over the course of his tenure, and unemployment rising to 10%, he faced spikes and downturns in approval rates, ultimately making him the most unpopular head of state under the Fifth Republic. On 1 December 2016, he announced he would not seek reelection in the 2017 presidential election, for which polls suggested his defeat in the first round. ...

Having reigned as Denmark's monarch for over 50 years, she is the world's only current queen regnant and the longest-serving current female head of state.

Born into the House of Glücksburg, a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg, Margrethe is the eldest child of King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid. She became heir presumptive to her father in 1953, when a constitutional amendment allowed women to inherit the throne. Margrethe succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972. On her accession, she became the first female monarch of Denmark since Margrethe I, ruler of the Scandinavian kingdoms in 1376–1412 during the Kalmar Union. In 1967, she married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, with whom she had two sons: Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim.

Margrethe is known for her strong archaeological passion and has participated in several excavations, including in Italy, Egypt, Denmark and South America. She shared this interest with her grandfather Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, with whom she spent some time unearthing artefacts near Etruria in 1962.

As of 2023, Margrethe has, as sovereign, received 42 official state visits and she has undertaken 55 foreign state visits herself. She and the royal family have made several other foreign visits. Support for the monarchy in Denmark has been and remains consistently high at around 82%, as does Margrethe's personal popularity.

Princess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at Frederik VIII's Palace, in her parents' residence at the Amalienborg palace complex, the principal residence of the Danish royal family in the district of Frederiksstaden in central Copenhagen. She was the first child of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess (later King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid). Her father was the elder son of the then-reigning King Christian X, while her mother was the only daughter of the Crown Prince of Sweden (later King Gustaf VI Adolf). Her birth took place just one week after Nazi Germany's invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940.

Margrethe was baptised on 14 May in the Holmen Church in Copenhagen. The Princess's godparents were King Christian X (paternal grandfather); Hereditary Prince Knud (paternal uncle); Prince Axel (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); King Gustaf V of Sweden (maternal great-grandfather); Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (maternal grandfather); Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten (her maternal uncle); and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (maternal great-grandfather).

She was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, Margaret, Crown Princess of Sweden, Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, Queen Alexandrine, and Ingrid after her mother. Since her paternal grandfather was also the King of Iceland, she was given the Icelandic name Þórhildur.

When Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her younger sister Princess Benedikte was born. Princess Benedikte later married Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister, Princess Anne-Marie, was born in 1946.

He performed lead roles with a youth theatre in works by Peter Schaffer, Carol Churchill, Philip Ridley, and many other great authors; getting the chance to perform in excellent theatres with excellent directors, both in England and abroad.

Continuing his education, Bennet went to the Bristol old Vic Theatre School at the age of 23. There he learnt how to speak Shakespeare, and a great many technical acting skills. Upon graduating he earned his bread and butter in television work, and has been lucky enough to gain his own children’s TV series „Captain Mack‟.

He also found time to come to Denmark and regularly perform in the Crazy Christmas Cabaret. By performing in „Wit‟ and „Love and Money‟ Bennet is getting back to what he loves best; performing in smaller intimate spaces with well-written works.",,,2,https://www.bennetthorpe.com/,nm1196679,Acting,Bennet Thorpe,,0.0352,

He led North Korea following the death of his father Kim Il Sung in 1994 until his own death in 2011, when he was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Un. Afterwards, Kim Jong Il was declared Eternal General Secretary of the WPK.

In the early 1980s, Kim had become the heir apparent for the leadership of North Korea, thus being established the Kim dynasty and he assumed important posts in party and army organizations. Kim was the General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), WPK Presidium, Chairman of the National Defense Commission (NDC) of North Korea and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), the fourth-largest standing army in the world.

Kim assumed leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union, on which it was heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies, which brought a famine. Kim strengthened the role of the military by his Songun (""military-first"") policies, making the army the central organizer of civil society. Kim's rule also saw economic reforms, including the opening of the Kaesong Industrial Park in 2003.

Following Kim's failure to appear at important public events in 2008, foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen seriously ill or died. On 19 December 2011, the North Korean government announced that he had died two days earlier, whereupon his third son, Kim Jong Un, was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and succeeded him.",1941-02-16,2011-12-17,2,,nm0453535,Acting,Kim Jong-il,"Khabarovsk, USSR",0.193,/rVFaJ6PqXy5jQCcCBLEa50YgeXV.jpg

Iréne Söderblom is the daughter of the ball bearing worker Erik Herman Söderblom and Hulda Maria, unmarried Ahl. She started playing accordion early, took lessons for Fredrik Tancred and was discovered when she won an accordion contest in Gothenburg in 1941. She then went to Åke Söderblom (with whom she is not related), Sickan Carlsson, Lasse Dahlquist, Maritta Marke and Thor Modéen. She was accordion soloist at Chinavarietén in 1944. Söderblom took talks at Calle Barcklind and was adopted in 1945 at Terserus Teaterskola. That same year she was engaged by the Casino Force where she played for ten seasons. She is one of the founders of the Stall Birds.

She was married to the actor and casino director Gösta Bernhard (1910-1986) in 1947-1970 and received her daughter Lillemor (born 1948). Then she was married to PR man Torsten Adenby (1918-1992) in 1971-1980.

From that day on, he was hooked on acting and started to pursue an career in Showbiz. That same year he got a part in an short film,called If it only was true, an poetic and artistic short film made by Trollhättan Filmstudents. He continued to do different small parts in both film and television but also some commercial work like an Infomercial for Ericsson. In 2004 he landed the part in the Swedish sci-fi Movie Storm by Måns Mårlind and Björrn Stein. Jörgen played one of the Goons: The evil and violent henchmen that male lead D.D played by Eric Ericsson and Female Heroinne Lova, played by Eva Röse is up against. Jörgen, who had to shave his head bald for the part, described the days on set as ""intense but wonderful."" He also believes the Directing-duo Mårlind/Stein has changed the way people look at Swedish films. In 2007 Jörgen joined a group of Swedish actors and stunt men dedicated to act and perform as Policeofficers in Movies and Television. Since then he has appeared in several small parts in Swedish films and TV productions. Besides acting Jörgen enjoys writing screenplays and is working on an concept for a new TV Drama series.",1978-05-17,,0,,nm2543078,Acting,Jörgen Berthage,Sweden,0.0143,

En rigtig troubadour med en karakteristisk stemme, der har leveret mange ørehængere – som ""25 minutter endnu"". Han indledte sin karriere i midten af 1950'erne som trompetist i jazzorkestret ""Mandagsorkestret"". Senere blev det blues- og folkemusik.

Der gik nogle år, før Dissing opnåede den brede anerkendelse, han  nyder i dag. Mange havde svært ved at forstå hans hæse og teatralske  fremførelser af sange fra den danske sangskat. En del syntes ikke, han  behandlede dem med værdighed, andre troede, han gjorde grin med dem.  Mange har hørt optagelsen fra '65 med Dissings ""Ak nej mor, gi' mig en  hest mor"", hvor publikum griner flere gange undervejs. Povl Dissing  spillede de gamle sange, som om det var amerikanske bluesnumre. Det var  yderst kontroversielt midt i 60'erne.

I slutningen af 60'erne indspillede Povl Dissing en række Shel Silverstein-numre oversat til dansk af Thøger Olesen. Han blev bl.a. bakket op af gruppen Beefeaters.  De indspilninger står som nogle af de centrale i dansk beat. Fx ""Den  grimmeste mand i byen"" og ""Kvælerslangen"". Desuden var Beefeaters  backing på Dissings album ""Dissing"", i folkemunde Nøgne øjne, ifølge Dansk Rockleksikon ""Kunst og skønhed på et meget højt plan"".[2]

Men det er gennem et tæt samarbejde med Benny Andersen  fx i ""Svantes Viser"" i 1973, at Povl Dissing langsomt nærmest er blevet  ""folkekær"". Tre sange fra deres anden plade ""Oven Visse Vande"" er med i  højskolesangbogen. Povl Dissings sang klæder viserne så godt, at han for mange er uløseligt knyttet til dem.

Povl Dissing har medvirket i mange teaterstykker, film og  tv-arbejder, heriblandt ""Lokomotivet Thomas og Hans Venner"", hvor han  lagde stemme til de første og de nyeste sæsoner. Han har udgivet ca. 25  lp'er/cd'er og har arbejdet sammen med bl.a. ""Fuzzy"", Peter Thorup og Benny Andersen. Han har tillige medvirket på henved 100 andre plader i alle rytmiske og melodiske genrer.

I de senere år har Povl Dissing også spillet sammen med sine sønner, Rasmus og Jonas, samt Las Nissen i kvartetten Dissing, Dissing, Las og Dissing.",1938-01-27,,0,,,Acting,Povl Dissing,Stavnsholt,0.0071,

1534062,{367599},False,[],"Hanne Boel (born 31 August 1957 in Bagsværd, Copenhagen) is a Danish singer.

Hanne Boel covers in her songs a range of styles including pop, soul, gospel, rock, and jazz. Over the course of her career, she has sold over 2.5 million records, and has had great success on the Scandinavian charts, although her work is less well known throughout the rest of the world.

Hanne Boel graduated from the Royal Danish Academy of Music in 1980, and then spent a year at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. In the five years following her return to Denmark, she divided her time between singing with the Danish funk band Blast, performing as a choir soloist, and teaching music at a variety of schools and clinics.

In 1987, Hanne Boel recorded a jazz album, Shadow of Love, with Jørgen Emborg, Mads Vinding, and Alex Riel. The following year she released her own album, Black Wolf, which featured performances in the R&B/soul vein. The album was a great success, winning her the Danish Music Award for Danish Female Singer of the Year. Her 1990 follow-up album, Dark Passion, won four 1991 Danish Music Awards: Album of the Year, Singer of the Year, Hit of the Year (""I Wanna Make Love to You""), and Producer of the Year (Poul Bruun).

Over the subsequent two decades, Hanne Boel has released 15 additional albums, and continues to enjoy success in Scandinavia. Her two most recent albums mark a return to a more jazz-influenced genre.

1540041,"{1290281, 95491}",False,[],"Suzanne Preis Brøgger Zeruneith (born 18 November 1944 in Copenhagen) is a Danish writer, a novelist, poet and journalist. Her first book Fri os fra kærligheden has been translated into c. 20 languages. Since 1997 she has been a member of the Danish Academy.

Brøgger grew up in Denmark until she was fourteen, after that she moved abroad with her mother and her stepfather Svend Brøgger, who worked for UNICEF and was stationed in Colombo, Sri Lanka and later in Bangkok, Thailand. Suzanne Brøgger returned to Denmark to attend high school a couple of years later. She finished the Silkeborg Gymnasium (a secondary school) in 1964, and she then studied Russian and French at the University of Copenhagen. She did not graduate, but has later said that her university days inspired her to constantly extend her horizons in life-long study.

While studying she also worked as a model and with films and theatre. Through articles in Danish newspapers in the form of interviews, travel descriptions and war articles, she got in touch with a publishing house, which offered her to publish her first book. Her first book was the essay collection Fri os fra kærligheden (Deliver Us from Love), which was published in 1973, it is critical against the western way of life. Her break through in Danish literature was Creme Fraiche, which was published in 1978. This book is the first of a trilogy of autobiographical books and describes her childhood and youth years in Denmark and in the South Asia/Southeast Asia (Sri Lanka and Thailand). In 1997 she published one of her main works the family saga Jadekatten (The Jade Cat: A Family Saga, 1997) where she writes about the same autobiographical themes as in the trilogy, which started with Creme Fraiche in 1973, but here she also writes about her Jewish family who immigrated from Poland to Denmark. Besides from being a portrayal of the loss of a family, it is also a showdown with her mother.

She is the daughter of Ove Preis (1920–69) and Lilian Henius (1921–93), stepdaughter of Svend Brøgger. She is married to Keld Zeruneith, they have one child together.

He was brought up in the name of art and he always knew that he wanted to be an actor. He went to various schools to explore his creative thinking. In the summer of 2005, he got his big break in the Danish feature films ""Angels in Fast Motion"" (Nordkraft) and ""Easy Skanking"" (Fidibus) and has since appeared in several movies, TV series and short films. He is a well-established actor in Denmark with a huge international potential.

His latest work consists of several leads in feature films. Among them is ""The Birdcatcher's Son"" which premiered in 2019 in 95 theaters in Sweden. It's on its merry way to International film festivals and distribution throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Also, the stylish horror-thriller ""Victim of Love"", a Danish-American feature film by Jesper Isaksen is in post-production with expected premiere also in 2019.

Short films has always been close to Rudi's heart and he's participated in numerous award winning shorts. Among them is ""Ødeland"" for which he won ""Best Male Actor"" at the prestigious ""Ekko Shortlist Awards 2016"" in Copenhagen, Denmark. He also won ""Best Male Actor"" for ""Heavyweight"" (Sværvægter) at ""Filmkraft Film Festival 2015"".

On the stage at ""Ekko Shortlist Awards"" Rudi announced his comeback and he is indeed turning the boat around.

2926009,{783587},False,[],"Heidi Weber, née Huggel (born June 4, 1927 in Münchenstein), is a Swiss interior designer, gallery owner, art collector, museum director, curator, publisher and exclusive representative of Le Corbusier's fine arts. She produced four of her avant-garde pieces of furniture from 1928 in small series and made them world famous. She was the initiator, financier and builder of Le Corbusier's last building in Seefeld in Zurich, which she called Maison Heidi Weber - Center Le Corbusier. From this center she engaged in the global dissemination of Le Corbusier's artistic work for almost half a century with exhibitions and loans, book publications and as an agent.

In June 1957, at the age of 30, Heidi Weber opened her “Mezzanin” gallery for furniture and interior design at Neumarkt 28 in Zurich. Here she presented furniture by George Nelson as well as Charles and Ray Eames and worked on interior design commissions. In 1958, the interior designer and gallery owner met Le Corbusier for the first time at Cap Martin. Between 1959 and 1964, she organized a total of 13 exhibitions on the artistic work of Le Corbusier in her “Mezzanin” gallery. The artist-architect then granted him exclusive marketing rights for his works: graphics, paintings, sculptures, tapestries and engravings for a period of 30 years.

Heidi Weber was the first to organize international exhibitions of her work and to organize traveling exhibitions of her art. Their stated goal was to make Le Corbusier's multifaceted artistic work known throughout the world. As an editor, she published books considered key works of her work as an artist.

In 1960, Heidi Weber entrusted Le Corbusier with the creation of La Maison de l'Homme in Zurich, designed as a cultural center dedicated to meetings and exhibitions on architecture and contemporary art. Inaugurated in 1967 after the death of the architect, the Heidi Weber Museum – Le Corbusier Center in Zurich can be considered a manifesto of the “synthesis of the arts” that Le Corbusier pursued throughout his life: “There is no of sculptors alone, of painters alone, of architects alone. The plastic event is accomplished in a “ONE FORM” in the service of poetry.”",1927-06-04,,1,https://www.heidiweber-centrelecorbusier.com/,nm10280832,Acting,Heidi Weber,"Zürich, Switzerland",0.0484,/qlndRL6xQ2Gy08HXCkIWD5SlIBG.jpg

The avant-garde project of total integration of art and society eventually leads out of art, and Louis-Jensen was among those who took this route, although he made more stops along the way than most. He pioneered Minimalism and a kind of Pop-brut-structure painting as well as producing graphic work, assemblages, happenings, films, and sound works. Around 1970 this full creative palette exploded into political activism. If to some extent Louis-Jensen disappeared from the establishment radar due to his peregrinations in and outside of art, with his radicalism and impatience he always seemed to be present even by default or through sheer charisma.

Ben Slimane had a tumultuous youth career, playing for eight different clubs in twelve years, but finally settled at AB where he made his senior debut in 2018. The following season, he departed for Brøndby and was included in the U19-squad, but he would garner break-out attention in the second half of the 2019–20 season as he established himself as part of the first team. At Brøndby, he was part of the Danish Superliga-winning team in 2020–21. After having made more than 100 appearances for the club, he departed for Premier League club Sheffield United in 2023.

Born in Denmark, Ben Slimane has dual citizenship and made appearances for both Denmark U19 and Tunisia U20. He represents Tunisia at senior international level, and has played at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.",2001-03-16,,2,,,Acting,Anis Slimane,"Copenhagen, Denmark",0.0,/yVeA6aNkGCqENUjnoSKL7ciXE3y.jpg

At the art school, she studied animation for four weeks under the guidance of Sara Koppel. It was during this time that her creativity flourished, leading to the creation of 'Else & Birthe' (2022), a hand-drawn 2D animation on paper, which she made together with Mads Theodor Bonde. Driven by their shared passion for traditional animation, they carried this approach into their next project and created their debut film 'Vandpyt' (2024).

'Vandpyt' premiered at the Odense Film Festival this year, where it won the award for Best Danish Animated Film, and at Viborg Animation Festival, the film also received the Open Workshop Danish Talent Award.",2001-12-28,,1,https://bondebrown.com,,Directing,Maria-May Backhaus Brown,"Hillerød, Denmark",0.0,/qU9V2r9qGOWTWjIqOI21WHyBHyj.jpg

The first time it got somehwere was in 2024 where his film ""Den Forsvundne"" advanced to the top 20 nominees for a publishing company. He is so far only based in denmark with most of his movies having a danish dialect. His movie ""A Hard Time"" is in his opinion ""My most complicated work yet"", the film also has his first directors cut tied to it, with it being the only motion picture in english. All of his projects have been limited to short lenght features but he stated that ""I would love to make longer movies, would it be hard? Yes, but its worth a shot"". His signature bold style stands strong. His signature wall turn shot is one of a rare kind.",,,2,,,Directing,Benyamin K.,"Skejby, Danmark",0.0,/69CQhHpjUEpyFQEBj3JsXO5CLqA.jpg
